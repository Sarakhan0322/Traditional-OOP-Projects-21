# Traditional OOP Projects

This repository contains various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects using Python. Each project demonstrates different concepts and techniques of OOP, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, decorators, and more.

## Projects

1. **Countdown Class**: An example of making a custom class iterable by implementing `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to count down from a given number.
2. **Custom Exceptions**: A project that creates and handles custom exceptions in Python (e.g., for age validation).
3. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: A demonstration of how method resolution works in Python when using multiple inheritance.
4. **Composition and Aggregation**: Examples of these design patterns, showcasing how one class can use instances of other classes.
